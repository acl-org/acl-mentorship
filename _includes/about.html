<!--            <h5> Overview </h5>-->
            <p>
                We are a mentorship network that supports junior researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
                Our mission is to promote equal access to career advice, guide students in initiating research, and foster a broader understanding of the field.
                People from all over the world are welcome to apply, and we are proud to have over <b>2,500 members worldwide</b>.
            </p>

            <h5>What is Year-Round Mentorship?</h5>
            <p>
                Year-Round Mentorship is an initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), created to provide mentorship opportunities for students entering the field of NLP.
                We host virtual mentorship meetings throughout the year with mentors from both academia and industry who bring significant expertise and successful career experience.
                Discussions cover a wide range of topics — from <em>“How to choose a research topic?”</em> and <em>“How to write a paper?”</em> to <em>“Should I pursue a PhD?”</em> and <em>“How do you maintain work–life balance?”</em>
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5>Why Become a Mentee?</h5>
            <p>
                As a mentee, you’ll gain guidance on career paths, research opportunities, and practical advice from people who’ve been where you are now.
                Whether you’re just getting started or considering your next step, mentorship can help you build confidence and clarity in your journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a mentor, you’ll have the opportunity to give back, share your knowledge, and inspire the next generation of AI/NLP researchers.
                Our mentors come from diverse backgrounds — advanced students, professors, and industry professionals — all united by a passion for supporting others.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h5>Who Can Join?</h5>
